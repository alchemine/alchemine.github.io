## Code
{% highlight python linenos %}
def solution(bridge_length, weight, truck_weights):
    answer = 0

    n_trucks = len(truck_weights)

    n_ends = 0
    bridge = [0] * bridge_length

    while n_ends < n_trucks:
        answer += 1
        if len(bridge) > 0:
            truck = bridge.pop(0)
            bridge.append(0)
            if truck != 0:
                n_ends += 1

        if len(truck_weights) == 0:
            continue

        if (bridge[-1] == 0) and (sum(bridge) + truck_weights[0] <= weight):
            cur_truck  = truck_weights.pop(0)
            bridge[-1] = cur_truck

    return answer
{% endhighlight %}


## Complexity
$O(n)$

- $n$ = len(truck_weights)
